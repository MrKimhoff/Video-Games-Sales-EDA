# Video Game Sales Exploratory Data Analysis

This project was a requirement for one of my classes during my Master's Data Science program at Bellevue Univeristy.

#### -- Project Status: `Completed`

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary purpose of this project was to select a dataset of choice and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Python programming language.

### Methods Used
* Data Munging
* Data Visualizaiton (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Summary Statistics

### Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* DataSpell (Data Science IDE)

## Project Description
The first step of this project was data collection. I selected a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). One of the guiding questions that I had working through this project was whether I could idenitfy which types of games would have the highest likelihood of success in terms of global sales. After getting the data loaded into a Pandas dataframe, there were some columns that needed to be cleansed. Once the data was in the proper format, I created several visualizations to gain a better understanding of the underlying data trends. Some of these visualizations included: `scatterplots`, `barplots`, `distribution plots`, and `countplots`. After visualizing the data, to identify how the features related I used Pearson's r to test for correlations. While there were no machine learning models trained during this project, after working through these steps the data was ready to be used for model training purposes.
